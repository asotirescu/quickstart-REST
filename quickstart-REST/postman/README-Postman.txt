README-Postman
------------------

Postman (http://www.getpostman.com/) is a REST client that runs either as a stand alone package or as an extension of Chrome.
It is quite useful for creating, testing and debugging REST requests.

The package can be downloaded from the URL above.
The extension can be installed by doing an extension search within Chrome.

WHAT'S IN HERE
--------------
This folder contains collections that can be imported into the Postman client, as well as a backup dump. 

GETTING STARTED
---------------
Once you install the Postman client, you can import each collection into it.
If you use the packaged client, you can import the whole database, including environments into it (the Chrome extension doesn't allow this at this time).
To do this, go to Settings-->Data and import the Backup.postman_dump file.
Note that if you import collections individually, you will have to create your own environments for them and set the appropriate variables.
