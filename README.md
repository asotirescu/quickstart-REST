# quickstart-REST

This project is aimed at developers who are just getting started using REST APIs.
It demonstrates some very simple and some a little more advanced uses of REST (via the Jersey 2.x implementation of JAX-RS).

The code is heavily documented and there is also an HTML documentation of all the methods (in the doc directory).
If you use Postman for unit testing, see the postman directory.

BUILD AND DEPLOY

A gradle build will create a war file that can be deployed in your HTTP container of choice (it has been tested with Tomcat 7).
